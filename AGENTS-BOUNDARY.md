# Workspace Boundaries (Agents-team)

This workspace contains multiple projects. To avoid cross-project confusion:

- Always `cd` into the target project root before running tools.
- State the target project name in the first message of each tool session.
- Do not read or edit other projects unless explicitly requested.

## Projects
- `Voice-sync prompter/` (VSP)
- `cc-system/`
- `plan.md` (workspace-level plan)
- `README.md` (workspace-level notes)
